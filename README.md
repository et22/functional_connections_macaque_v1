# ccg-paper

To generate paper figures, run 
-plot_cluster_figures_prez.m file plots the most recent version 
-.ipynb files contain plot figures 1-3. 

Plotting requires output files that I did not put in this repo because they are large. 

The config file is used to set configuration for analysis and clustering. 

The run_all function computes ccgs and postprocesses and clusters results.
